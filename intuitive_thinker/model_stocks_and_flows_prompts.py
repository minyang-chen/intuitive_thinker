# System thinking: Stocks and Flow
# Stocks and flows are the foundation of system dynamics modeling.
# Stocks, which are accumulations, would continue to exist. Flows, how-ever, would disappear, because they are actions.

# how exactly do they work?
# Stocks are entities that can accumulate or be depleted, such as a bathtub, which fills with water from a faucet. Inventory and Installed Base are examples of stocks. Flows

# Flows, on the other hand, are entities that make stocks increase or decrease, like a faucet or drain affects the level of water in a bathtub. Production (which increases Inventory) and Purchases by Consumers (which increases Installed Base) are examples of flows. Note that flows are the only variables that can change stocks.


# Identify and Create the Stocks

# The next step is to determine which CLD variables are stocks. The previous step of specifying the units helps facilitate this process by indicating which variables involve time and, therefore, are probably flows. (Note, however, that just because a variable is a function of time does not necessarily mean that it is a flow; it depends on the CLD’s overall function). Double-check your ideas about which variables in the CLD are stocks — and identify any additional stocks that might be needed — by following the guidelines given in Part I of this series. In the product life-cycle example, the two stocks are Potential Customers and Installed Base.
# Identify and Create the Flows

# Once you have identified the stocks, it is easy to identify the flows: They are simply the variables that add to or subtract from the stocks. Only a flow can increase or decrease a stock, so if a variable is directly influencing a stock and is a function of time, it’s a good bet that it’s a flow. In our example, the only flow is People Buying Product.
# Connect Flows to Stocks and Stocks to Flows (if Necessary)

# The first task in this step is to connect all flows to the stocks that they influence. If the flow has a negative effect on the stock, then it’s an outflow; if it has a positive effect, it’s an inflow. For example, as the flow People Buying Product increases, the stock Installed Base increases, because People Buying Product is an inflow to Installed Base. On the other hand, as the flow People Buying Product increases, the stock of Potential Customers declines.

   b. Present a clear plan of steps to solve the problem.
   c. Use a "Chain of Thought" reasoning process if necessary, breaking down your thought process into numbered steps.
3. Include a <stocks_and_flow> systems thinking section:    
    a. Define Stocks and Flows
       - Stocks: These are quantities that exist at a given time. For example, in a manufacturing system, the stock might be the number of units produced.
       - Flows: These are rates of change of stocks over time. For instance, in the same manufacturing system, the flow might be the rate at which units are produced per hour.
    b. Identify the System Boundaries
       - Determine what is included within the system and what is outside.
       - Example: In a supply chain management system, the boundaries might include production facilities, warehouses, distribution centers, retailers, and customers.
    b. Map the Stocks and Flows
       - Visualize the stocks and flows using diagrams or charts.
    c. Analyze Relationships Between Stocks and Flows
       - Understand how changes in one stock affect other stocks and flows.
4. Include a <reflection> section for each idea where you:
   a. Review your reasoning.

Aim to be precise and logical in your approach, and don't hesitate to break down complex problems into simpler components. Your tone should be analytical and slightly formal, focusing on clear communication of your thought process.
