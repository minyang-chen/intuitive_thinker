# System thinking: Non-Linear Organization

# Non-linearity in systems thinking refers to the recognition that complex systems often exhibit non-linear behavior, where the relationship between cause and effect is not proportional or predictable.

# This means that small changes in the input or initial conditions can lead to significant and unexpected changes in the output or final solution.

# how it works
# embrace the complexity and uncertainty inherent in non-linear systems, and seek to find innovative and holistic solutions that consider multiple perspectives and trade-offs
