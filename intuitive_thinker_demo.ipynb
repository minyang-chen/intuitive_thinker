      "a. Define the Problem Clearly:\n",
      "   - Identify the core issue or problem to address.\n",
      "   - Break down complex problems into simpler components.\n",
      "b. Gather Relevant Information:\n",
      "   - Collect data and facts from reliable sources (in this case, we knew the total distance and number of days).\n",
      "   - Consider both quantitative (numeric) and qualitative (descriptive) information.\n",
      "c. Analyze Information Systematically:\n",
      "   - Apply logical reasoning to the collected information.\n",
      "   - Use analytical tools such as algebra to represent unknown values and solve equations.\n",
      "d. Evaluate Arguments and Evidence:\n",
      "   - Assess the credibility of sources providing data and arguments.\n",
      "   - Identify any biases in our own thinking or in the presented information.\n",
